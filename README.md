# Tenders
This study proposes a methodology for evaluating and comparing the performance of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classification models, integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques and rule-based systems. The aim is to support the optimisation of the tender award process in European Union countries by identifying historical conditions that have favoured certain awards.
The approach allows for the suggestion of possible favourable scenarios for new tenders that meet similar parameters. In addition, the results are analysed and visualised through classification metrics and multi-class confusion matrices, which allow for the suggestion of possible favourable scenarios for new tenders that meet similar parameters. Furthermore, the results are analysed and visualised through classification metrics and multi-class confusion matrices, which allow for the suggestion of possible favourable scenarios for new tenders that meet similar parameters. The approach allows for the suggestion of possible favourable scenarios for new tenders that meet similar parameters. In addition, the results are analysed and visualised through classification metrics and multi-class confusion matrices, facilitating a comprehensive comparative evaluation of the performance of both models.

# Purpose of the repository:

This repository contains the code, experimental notebooks, and methodological artefacts
used in the scientific article:

"Analysis of public tenders with Rule Systems to improve decision-making"

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate experimental reproducibility, verification of
results, and methodological evaluation by academic reviewers. The repository is presented as supplementary material to the article.
